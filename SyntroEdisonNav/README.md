# SyntroEdisonNav

SyntroEdisonNav is an Intel Edison SyntroNet app for streaming IMU data across a nework. A separate app, SyntroNavView can be used to display the data stream. The stream consists of the raw sensor data (gyro, accelerometer and magnetometer) along with a pose generated by fusing the sensor data with a Kalman filter.

Check out www.richards-tech.com and search for SyntroEdisonNav to find more instructions and advice.

SyntroEdisonNav uses the RTIMULib IMU library. Check out https://github.com/richards-tech/RTIMULib for more information on the operation of the library and configuration of the system via the RTIMULib.ini settings file.

Note that SyntroEdisonNav uses I2C1 to connect to the IMU chip.

There is no way of performing magnetometer calibration at the moment. This will be in a future release.
